Python Bindings version 2 API Reference
=======================================

.. warning::

    This a preview release of the second major version of the HTCondor
    Python bindings.

    We are making this preview available in the 24.0.x stable series
    so our customers who don't install the feature series will be able
    to test their existing Python scripts against the new modules.

    (These modules are now also included in the PyPI releases.)

    Because this is a preview release, we may make larger changes more
    quickly than we would otherwise, which may include removing features
    without formally deprecating them.  We presently hope and expect that
    all such changes will be made in the 24.y feature series of releases,
    but this does allow for incompatible changes between 24.0.x and 25.0.x.

    Please test your code earlier rather than later, so that we will have
    time to fix any problems you may discover.

    Thanks for the reading all the way through. :)
